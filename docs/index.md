# Documentation Index

This directory contains supplementary documentation to help you run, test, and extend the frontend.

- `expectations.md` — What to expect when running the app locally (prereqs, env, common pitfalls).
- `payloads.md` — Example request/response shapes for `/api/ask` and `/api/jira-tickets` and notes about sanitization.
- `troubleshooting.md` — Common errors, quick fixes, and how to collect useful logs for debugging.
- `deployment.md` — Build and deployment notes for serving the static site in various environments.

If you'd like additional docs (architecture deep-dive, tests, CI/CD examples), tell me which topics to add next.
